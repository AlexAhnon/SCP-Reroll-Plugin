# SCP-Reroll-Plugin
 A custom plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory that allows SCP players to reroll their SCP into a new random one.


The plugin gives the SCP players 10 seconds to reroll their SCP into a new one by inputting .scproll in the client console. No config options as of yet. The plugin prevents rerolling into existing SCPs or the one you're already playing.
