# SCP-Reroll-Plugin (Currently OUTDATED)
 A custom plugin for [EXILED](https://github.com/galaxy119/EXILED) and SCP: Secret Laboratory that allows SCP players to reroll their SCP into a new random one.


The plugin gives the SCP players 10 seconds to reroll their SCP into a new one by inputting .scproll in the client console. No config options as of yet. The plugin prevents rerolling into existing SCPs or the one you're already playing.
